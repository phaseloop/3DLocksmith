# 2D lock pick templates

Vector files gathered from various places of the Internet (most notably [LockLab](https://locklab.com/downloads-links-bosnianbills-locklab/)).

Those are 2D outlines used to create DIY lock-picks, jigglers, etc.

You can try converting those shapes to 3D object and print 2-4 layer high object on a 3D printer to use the print to outline a shape on a piece of metal for futher grinding.

See 3D lock templates for ready to print files.
