# 2D lock pick templates

Vector files gathered from various places of the Internet or recreated and dimensioned from public photos.

Most notable sources of files present here:

- [RedditLockPicks](https://github.com/redditlockpicks/designs)


Those are 2D outlines used to create DIY lock-picks, jigglers, etc.

You can try converting those shapes to 3D object and print 2-4 layer high object on a 3D printer to use the print to outline a shape on a piece of metal for futher grinding.

Alternatively, on hobby CNC machine you can use diamond engraving bit to trace the shape on metal (hobby CNC machines usually won't be good for cutting steel).

See 3D lock templates for ready to print files.
